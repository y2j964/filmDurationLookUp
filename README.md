# filmDurationLookUp
This python script will take an Exel file of film titles (represented here by 'dvr_pandas.xlsx'), convert it to a Pandas db, and webscrape Rotten Tomatoes for the film duration. It will then update your Exel file with the found duration values. If there are type errors in your spreadsheet, the script will try to deduce the film you intended and ask the user appropiate questions for confirmation.
